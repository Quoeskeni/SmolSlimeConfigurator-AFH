- Single-file executables are available from [Releases](https://github.com/ICantMakeThings/SmolSlimeConfigurator/releases) (Windows, Linux, macOS, Android).
- Python file from the uploaded files above.
- To build it from source, run:
```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --icon=icon.png --add-data "icon.png:." --add-binary "/Location/To/UR/NameOfVenv/bin/nrfutil:." SmolSlimeConfiguratorV8.py
```
*Note you NEED to use a venv, NEED to use python 3.10.xx & change the .png to .icns on mac and .ico on windows*

# Instructions
**Note:** There is a [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/2PHelwy7Rcs) explaining general usage, and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENINHh4L8tk) covers **Android usage** in detail.
## **First install**

+ Plug in the tracker or reciever, hold one side of a wire on rst pin ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7cdaae27-21f9-428f-9327-d39bbf8dabc2) (4th pin down from where B+ pin is)
and doubble tap gnd (usbc connector on the Nice!Nano)![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1efbc20-bb2f-4fd8-9ecd-8869648ebf17)
+ Press "↻" refresh, then select the port from the dropdown menu on the left of the refresh button, then press "Connect"
+ Select the version of hardware from the dropdown menu called "Select Firmware", press "⬇ Firmware",  Wait ~20 seconds, the tracker will flash.

## **Pairing**
  
+ Plug in your Reciever, press "↻" refresh and select the port And then press "Connect"
+ To Configure your reciever, select the reciever tab, press pairing mode and power on each reciever one by one, you should notice ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab48dff0-e0f6-4113-a7f7-222260115964) the trackers being added, once all the trackers have been paired, press "Exit Pairing Mode"


## **AFH tools**

AFH firmware builds expose two extra serial commands that are available from both the **Tracker** and **Receiver** tabs:

+ **AFH Info** sends `afh_info` and prints the current AFH channel, state, error counter, and epoch in the log.
+ **Force Channel 100** sends `afh_set_channel 100` to force the radio back to channel 100 / 2500 MHz, which is the expected AFH discovery/pairing channel for compatible firmware builds.

If pairing does not start, connect the receiver and each tracker over USB, press **Force Channel 100**, then check **AFH Info** before entering pairing mode.

## **Calibration**

+ Plug in a tracker, Press "↻" refresh, select the COM port & "Connect", press "Calibrate 6 Sides", do what the terminal says.
+ Then press "Calibrate", leave the tracker on a desk for 5~ seconds and done!

**Note: You can also doubble tap the trackers button instead of pressing "Calibrate"**

## **Updating Firmware**

+ Connect to the port, select the firmware, press "⬇ Firmware" and wait ~20 seconds.

**Note: Trackers and recievers need to be all updated on the same version or they wont want to pair**

# Odd notes:

+ If you want to feel safe running this program, read the Python code and run it from the .py.
+ If a tracker has old pair data it wont connect to your reciever, plug your tracker in and "Clear Con. data".
+ If the trackers and recievers arent on the same daily build, they will not want to connect.
+ There is a [.html](https://github.com/jitingcn/SmolSlimeWebConfigurator) version of this app, and hosted on a [website](https://gh.jtcat.com/SmolSlimeConfigurator.html), made by [jitingcn](https://github.com/jitingcn).
